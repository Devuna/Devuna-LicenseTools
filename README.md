Clarion tools to add License Notice to source files.

The applications included in this repository are tools that I wrote to assist in adding license notices to my Clarion source files for publication to GitHub.

### AddCopyright ###

This application can be used to add a copyright and license notice to the start of any text files you select for processing.  Designed primarily for use with \*.INC, \*.CLW, \*.TPL, \*.TPW, \*.HTM, and \*.HTML files.

### LicenseTXA ###

This application can be used to inject a copyright and license notice into the global data and every module and procedure in an application *.TXA file.  Works *most* of the time.
